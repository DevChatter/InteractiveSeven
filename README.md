# Interactive Seven (I7)

The definitive application for Final Fantasy 7 streamers, providing **chat interaction**, **live status display (Tseng)**, and custom overlay menus. It pulls data from your copy of the game using [Elena](https://github.com/Shojy/Elena), so you can use it with most FF7 mods.

## Setting Up and Running I7

Run the `InteractiveSeven.exe`, which will start the program. Switch to the **Settings tab**, look in the **Twitch Settings** section, and put in the username of your bot, the channel you stream on, and your `oauth` access token.
