# Interactive Seven (I7)

The definitive application for Final Fantasy 7 streamers, providing **chat interaction**, **live status display (Tseng)**, and custom overlay menus. It pulls data from your copy of the game using [Elena](https://github.com/Shojy/Elena), so you can use it with most FF7 mods.

## Setting Up and Running I7

Run the `InteractiveSeven.exe`, which will start the program. Switch to the **Settings tab**, look in the **Twitch Settings** section, and put in the username of your bot, the channel you stream on, and your `oauth` access token.

## Using Interactive Seven

Start up the I7 Program and navigate to the settings tab. Once there, you'll want to choose the Twitch Settings tab. Add your Twitch credentials. Once added, be sure to Save Settings.

Now you can connect to Twitch. Once connected, you can use any commands that are enabled in the settings. Be sure to check the [I7 User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md) for some basic command instructions.
